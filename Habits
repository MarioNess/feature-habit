Habit 1

I agree with his opinion that programming is physically demanding activity because programmer sits on chair all day.
Sitting is not the natural human resting position.
One of the best solutions to prevent your body from harm is exercising. On youtube are many videos about exercise especially for sedentary workers
Next one is walk to kitchen for coffee break.  

Habit 2
Have a get-it-done attitude. Keep your eye on the goal. Be productive. Do not stop for a long time on the details.
A lot of programmers spend lot of times with solwing small trivial bugs.
