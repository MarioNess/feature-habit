Habit 1

I agree with his opinion that programming is physically demanding activity because programmer sits on chair all day.
Sitting is not the natural human resting position.
One of the best solutions to prevent your body from harm is exercising. On youtube are many videos about exercise especially for sedentary workers
Next one is walk to kitchen for coffee break.  

Habit 2
Have a get-it-done attitude. Keep your eye on the goal. Be productive. Do not stop for a long time on the details.
A lot of programmers spend lot of times with solwing small trivial bugs.

Habit 3
Keep it simple, consistency
Programming is one of those fields that is dominated by extremely arrogant people.
They want to show whole world how smart and intelligent they are, so they write really brutally difficult code which is difficult to understand for many people.
But beauty is simplicity. Simple code consistency is a way to make life easier for us and our colleagues.

Habit 4
The "zone". is the most prodictive time for programmers when you are just coding and you are just swimming througt that code and you lose track of time.
If you want to get into the "zone" you can't often be interrupted by people or phone. You need peace and quiet maybe some music or other rituals to concentrate on writing code.

Habit 5
Always be learning sharpening yourself. Getting out of your comfort zone. It is easier to stay at one level in our jobs, but if we want to improve in our jobs we have
to get out of our comfort zone and we have to learn trough our whole life. With new skills we can move from junior to  medior or senior level and of course we have a higher salaries.
